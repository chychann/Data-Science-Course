1. After unzipping my file, you can see 311706002.py, CNN.pth, 311706002_pred.csv, and this .txt file.

2. Next, you can execute the 311706002.py file to demo. It will use the CNN.pth file to run model.

3. If you demo my code, its result will replace the original 311706002_pred.csv. The csv file can upload to Kaggle.
